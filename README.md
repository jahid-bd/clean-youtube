**Project: Clean Youtube**

**Description:** Description: We often watch important videos or tutorials on YouTube to study. But many times it is seen that we lose our attention due to the large number of videos on YouTube.As a result instead of watching the video that I want to watch, I watch another video. Moreover, there are a lot of advertisement problems while watching the video.

So to solve this problem, I have made an application where if you copy the link or ID of the playlist from YouTube and paste it in my application, the playlist will be added to the application.

And you can watch any video you want from there without any distraction. Absolutely clean youtube ðŸ˜Š.

**Features:**

1. If you copy the link or ID of the playlist from YouTube and paste it in the specific place of the application, it will be added to the playlist application through the YouTube API and more than one can be added but not more than 20. Moreover, after watching the videos, they can be removed from there.

2. Playlists can be kept as favorite items and removed from there.

3. The last playlists viewed will be added to the Recents item. However, the last five items will not be more than what can be seen in recent.

4. The playlist will show the videos very nicely serialized and the video that will be played will show the active. Moreover, the title of the video and the playlist, when it was uploaded, can be seen

5. The same playlist cannot be added more than once. Moreover, the validation is done in a very nice way, for example, if you paste the wrong link or give some other input, it will show an error.

6. The playlists that were added to the application or added to the recent items, as long as you were playing the videos, all the information will be saved in the local store. That is, when you edit these videos and go out of the application or re-enter, you will see everything in the previous state.

7. The application is fully responsive i.e. you can use it from any device.

**Technology:**

1. React (vite)

2. React Router

3. Material UI

4. Easy Peasy (Redux)

5. Sass

6. Axios
